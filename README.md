# Measuring the Pulse of Prosperity  
**An Index of Economic Freedom Analysis**

## üìä Overview
This project evaluates global economic freedom using the Heritage Foundation's **Index of Economic Freedom** and related data. We explore how freedom correlates with prosperity, income, governance, and social indicators.

Key objectives:
- Analyze trends in economic freedom across countries.
- Compare freedom scores with GDP, human development, and other global indices.
- Highlight regional patterns, winners, and laggards.
